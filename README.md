### What I learned

I have learned some new concepts through the designing of this project, the concepts that i learned is
how to design layout using css grids, a concept i have never tried in any of my previous projects.

I have also learned how to set media queries width breakpoints, though still need a lot of practice to be perfect with the concept.


### Continued development

Setting media queries breakpoints has been a challenge to me, whenever i try to use them in a project, i would spend a lot of time figuring out the correct design and layout at certain breakpoints.
